# GetYourLoanApp

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the GetyourLoanApp application.
This app is the demo app for the Pluralsight course [JavaScript Variables and Types](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-variables-types/).

You can download a copy of the code and follow along in the course.

The application consists out of a simple HTML file, with some CSS and, most importantlty, a JavaScript file. 

```
const arr = [3,4,5];
var arr = Object.freeze([3,4,5])

let longnum = 13423542090909093 + 1
Number.isSafeInteger(longnum)
